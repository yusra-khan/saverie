# G-Tech Project Proposal

### **Product Name**
Saverie - Eat more, Waste less

### **Team Members**
Yusra Khan, Ayesha Zafar, Ishmal Khalid, Zunair Viqar

### **Mission Statement**
To minimize food wastage and maximize access to affordable meals.

### **What and why?**

Every year about 40 million tons of food in the United States ends up in landfills. This equates to approximately 40% of the entire US food supply (source: https://www.rts.com/resources/guides/food-waste-america/). Restaurants and other food businesses are big contributors to these numbers as, at the end of the day, there is bound to be leftover food that inevitably goes to waste.

We aim to build an extensive and dynamic marketplace with restaurants, bakeries, cafes and other businesses in the food industry. The product serves to any food suppliers and to anyone else with access to the internet as a consumer. It will allow for food business to log any food items that are available with them, and would rather go to waste, to be viewed by the general population that could potentially consume it to reduce wastage.

### **Our inspiration**

As study away students on a tight budget, we have to manage our budgets very carefully. On top of that, we watched two instances of food wastage unfold infront of us which made us want to develop an application which could benefit everyone simultaneously.

In only our first week in New York, as we embarked on our search for Halal Food, we came across a restaurant called Holy Cow. As we finished up our meal, the restaurant owner reached out to us with an offer to take 3 burgers, if we wish to, for free. Upon inquiry, since the free offer came off as a surprise, the owner told us that someone had placed an order but they never showed up to receive it. As the food may have gone to waste otherwise, we were offered without any charge.

Only a week later after the aforementioned case, we arrived at a 7 Eleven franchise looking for Pizzas. However, we were met with another surprise as the attendee informed us that they had trashed the pizzas only a few minutes back since no came to pick them up.

At this point, we wished there was a platform that provides accessibility to the general population with an opportunity to receive and consume food that would otherwise go to waste. This would help reduce the wastage of food, as well as allow restaurants to rather sell the food for a very discounted price to cover the losses, or even give it away for free. It branches opportunities like those of immediate consumption for even shelf items that are closing to expiry.

### **For whom?**

Our software will allow food businesses, such as restaurants or grocery stores, to register on our application as verified food distributors and log their leftover food inventories towards the end of their business hours; consumers will be able to access the information logged by food distributors and obtain the food at the reduced price set by the distributors.

### **How?**
Members:
- 2 end users: distributors and the general public
- Businesses:
    - Expected to register by providing their location, operating hours and menu
    - The businesses can log in the food items that are currently available for pickup
    - Businesses have options to add quantity for a menu item, edit descriptions, location and operating hours
    - Extra Features
        - Businesses can offer delivery options if customer is located nearby
- General Public:
    - Can follow businesses and get notifications when items are available for pick-up
    - A news feed displays all food distributors' who currently have food available
    - Users can reserve food and can select a time frame within which they have to pick-up the item [time frames range from 15 to 45 mins, at 15 min increments] and get their food or else that particular item will be made available to everyone again
    - Extra Features
        - Users can browse restaurants near their location on  a map
        - Recommend food options to users based on user history

### **Scope**
- The application would have two interfaces. One would be for the restaurants (suppliers) end, to log in the food that they would be willing to give away or sell, and the other for the consumers to avail the benefit from the restaurants.
- The data management side of the project would require extensive work:
  - In managing the database for the restaurants, for when they register on the application,
  - and also for the users that access our application and sign up on it.
  - It will also require storing any product information that is uploaded, with images and other details, for the items that are to be given away by the restaurants.
- The implementation of the login system would be required for the user to register with their email addresses, and then log back in when they need to in the future. The portal for restaurants would also require a similar login or registration system.
- The user interface would have to be very extensive. It should include a dashboard, or a newsfeed, that displays all the current available items. It should also allow for multiple filters, as well as searching options and reaching out to the restaurants. We also want to include a 'page system' for restaurants to allow the users with the option to check all the registered restaurants, even if they do not currently have available items, to allow them with an option to follow them with email notifications for any future availability. Lastly, an option to 'claim' the food items that are on the dashboard which would book the items for a certain time period.
- Similarly, on the restaurants' end, an interface would be available that allows them to update the menu items and keep track of the item 'claims' with information of the users that have claimed them. Additionally, we plan on implementing the functionality of allowing them to offer delivery options or allow the pickup of items with Google Maps location of where they are located.
- An added functionality would be the option for the consumers to chat with the restaurants (the suppliers) to discuss any potential questions that they have.
- Extra features (depending on time): a chatbot with any FAQs to report problems, or inquire anything about the application.
