# Guide to Contributing
## Team Norms
* When possible, make sure members of the team collaborate through video or conference calls
* It is advised to maintain a group of 6 members (+/- 2), particularly those who understand the problem Saverie tries to solve
* Having a team that has broad knowledge across several areas and deep knowledge in specific areas would help

### Team Values
Members of the team must let each other know about current or upcoming changes, though it is sufficient to work on tasks individually (especially if members have conflicting schedules). If members need help, they should use Slack for group discussions and updates, or alternatively any other agreed-upon methods of communication (text, calls, etc). If any conflicts arise:
* A consensus must be reached over a video/conference call, where others provide their perspective as well.
* When a member is failing to deliver on their obligations, respectful reminders and scheduled talks must occur to maintain productivity and civility.
* If a member directs a message to someone, they must respond in a timely manner (e.g. no longer than 2 days).

### Sprint Cadence
A sprint should take anywhere between 1-4 weeks, preferably 2 weeks (too short creates panic/stress, while too long creates an overly relaxed mood)

### Daily Standups
These will occur every few days, usually for 30 minutes to an hour. Members are expected to participate in every standup. No one should cover for other members, and those who do not make progress on a task for two or more standups consecutively will be spoken to.

### Coding Standards
VS Code should be used as the team's code editor. Code for each task and spike must be peer reviewed and pass tests before merging into the `main` branch of code. Make sure to provide descriptive commit messages. Commits much contain minimum, self-documented code without unnecessary/dead code. Please test before pushing.

## Git Workflow
When collaborating with the team, always pull before making any changes to your branch. When creating tasks, please assign labels/be descriptive. Likewise, when finishing tasks, please update the task board. If a team member recommends a change, they must not wait to message or speak to the group.

## Rules of Contribution
As mentioned previously, always consult the group whenever any current or upcoming changes occur, and confirm that no breaking changes will result from them. If tasks are created, try to contribute a relatively reasonable amount of work so that everyone makes progress fairly.
