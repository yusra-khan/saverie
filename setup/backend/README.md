## Instructions on How to Set Up and Run the Back-End Project

#### If you have already forked/ cloned the repository, you may skip the first 2 steps

### Step 1: Forking and Cloning

To make sure that the original copy of the project is not affected, please: <br/>

- navigate to the [project-setup-g-tech repository](https://github.com/software-students-fall2021/project-setup-g-tech) and fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner; <br/>
- clone your forked repository to your local computer using "git clone {HTTPS address of the repo}" <br/>

### Step 2: Install Node.js

Since Express JS is the tool used in coding the back-end of the project one must first [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/. <br />

### Step 3: Run "npm install" inside of the back-end folder on terminal to install all dependencies written in package.json

Some dependencies used in the front-end of the project include: Express.js, Mocha & Chai for unit testing, as well as Istanbul NYC. <br/>

### Step 4: Create .env file
Make sure to have the necessary .env file to communicate with the database and to verify tokens. The .env file should have DB_DOMAIN, JWT_SECRET and FRONT_PATH (which is the address on which the front-end is running).<br/>

### Step 5: Run "npm start" on terminal within the back-end folder to run the front-end

Run "npm start" on terminal within the front-end folder to run the front-end of the project. <br/>
